README - PLEASE READ BEFORE USING
---------------------------------

1. Run the file from the command prompt
	a. cd to the directory and then type HuffmanTree.exe
	b. Hit 'Enter'

2. Enter the ROOT directory where the files you are going to 
	test are. Please refer to the example file (stuff.txt).
	Files should be a one-line, multi-character string
	without any (*) characters.
	Directory should look like:
	c:/users/name/desktop/ or the equivalent without the
	last slash (the program compensates for it.

3. Enter the name of the file (eg. stuff.txt).

4. The file will read the character string and output the
	code and final string to the desktop.

5. FYI: In case you think the program cuts corners,
	source code has been included to show the endless
	amount of work that has been put into this ;)

6. Thanks!
